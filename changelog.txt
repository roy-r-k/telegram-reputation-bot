v0.14
- Added parse_mode='HTML' to send_message command that used string with HTML

v0.13
- Removed handle_response and nested all commands inside handle_messages so more fine-grained control is possible w.r.t. bot actions on commands instead of only reply_to_message

v0.12
- Removed code to check on every message if user exists in database. If user suspects he is not registered, he can use !register
- Update string from !register to make it more clean when user was already registered

v0.11
- Small bugfix: !stats command from bot help was !getstats. Changed to !stats
- Small bugfix: In method to try to fill username if not yet available, wrong var was used so firstname was inserted in reality. Changed to username var

v0.10
- Changelog added
- Small bugfix: If user left but was not in database, code would add user on to database in memory but did not save to file. Fixed.
